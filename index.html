          <h2>About Me</h2>

          <p>I'm originally from Lompoc, a small town on the central coast of California. After graduating high school, I moved to Oregon to attend college and enjoy all of the outdoor activities that Oregon has to offer.</p>

          <p>In college, I had planned to major in computer science, but as an out-of-state student, tuition became a difficult hurdle to overcome. Thankfully, discovering Thinkful has helped me respark my passion for becoming a web developer. Most of my past jobs in the service industry have made me appreciate and look forward to working in a team setting to tackle a project or task!</p>

          <p>When I'm not working, I can be found doing some of my favorite activities:

            <ul>
              <li>
                Cooking all kinds of vegan food (my favorite place for recipes is <a href='http://www.bosh.tv'>Bosh</a>)
              </li>
              <li>
                Practicing Yoga
              </li>
              <li>
                Hiking all throughout the Pacific Northwest and taking photos along the way. Check out my <a href='gallery.html'>gallery!</a>
              </li>
              <li>
